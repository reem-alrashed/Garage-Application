# GarageApplication
This project aims overall to support the concept of selling and buying the used product when the owner does not need them anymoreâ€”providing customers with a straightforward process of not throwing the unused item in the garbage or keeping them in a warehouse. Throwing in the trash too much, cause pollution, which causes harm to humans, animals and the environment. Therefore, the target is creating an android mobile application that gives customers the ability to sell and buy pre-owned items.   

Due to the absence of adequate recycling practices and support for the reuse idea, waste is typically discarded or burned directly, resulting in critical pollution of the environment. Trash creates pollution, and that is damaging to people, wildlife as well as the atmosphere.
Hence, a garage store is going to be implemented that is workable on the android operating system. It intends to encourage the idea of reusing products, by providing a user-friendly store application. The application support two types of users admin and customer. The admin is responsible for managing and controlling the system. Admin can log in the system and then view all customers information and the sales.  Customers, after signing in the system and log in, can do both selling their used items and buy other customer's items as well.
- Some of our system limitations are:  

Users: Admin and Customer.  

Language: The application support Arabic language.   

Operating System: The application will be developed in an android platform.
